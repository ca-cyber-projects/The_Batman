    Signup for a free AWS account 

    Enter all the necessary info 

      Name 

      Address 

      Credit card 

    Under “Services” in the upper-right, select “Compute” and then “EC2” 

    Select “Launch Instance” 

    Launch an EC2 instance of “OpenVPN Access Server” from the AWS Marketplace (select the one that says free tier eligible) 

    Select the “t2.micro” Instance type (or whichever says free) then click Review and Launch 
 
    Create a new key pair to authenticate to your instance securely, remember the name of this key 

    Download the key pair and remember the file path of the key pair and click “Launch Instance” 

    Navigate back to the page from step 2 and wait for your instance to launch 

    Once your instance shows as running in “Instance state” field, right click your instance and select “Connect” 

    You’ll get a popup that gives you several options to connect 

    Open up Powershell/CMD prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux), keep the default standalone SSH client option 

    Navigate to the file path where you put the key pair and enter the following command 

      chmod 400 [your_private_key_name.pem] 

      This prevents your key pair from being publicly viewable 

    Enter the following into the prompt:  

      ssh -i [/path/to/key/pair/key_pair.pem] root@[your_ec2_instance_ip].amazonaws[.]com 

    Agree to the terms and conditions/defaults (press enter to agree) 

    Once the terms and conditions have been agreed to, you will need to login as the “openvpnas” user, enter the following: 

      ssh -i [/path/to/key/pair/key_pair.pem] openvpnas@[your_ec2_instance_ip].amazonaws[.]com 

    Enter this command to change the admin password (remember this password):  

      sudo passwd openvpn 

    Go back to AWS and select your OpenVPN Access Server instance 

    Scroll down to the “IPv4 Public IP” and copy the IP 

    Enter the following into the address bar: https://[your.public.ip.address]:943/admin 

      Port 943 is the default port for OpenVPN Access Server to access the Admin and Client Web interfaces 

    The page will show that your computer does not trust the certificate provided, this is due to a self-signed cert, proceed to the page 

    Login to the admin page with the openvpn user and the password you set in step 16 

    Agree to the terms and conditions 

    To ensure your traffic is encrypted by the VPN, click the “Configuration” option on the left and select “VPN settings” 

    Under routing, change “Should client internet traffic be routed through the VPN?” to “Yes” 

    Click “Save settings” at the bottom of the page 

    Click “Update running server” at the top to push your changes to the OpenVPN Access Server 

    Next you need to download the OpenVPN client to connect to your VPN 

    Navigate back up to the address bar and enter https://[your.public.ip.address]:943, this will point you to the user login (use the same credentials as you did in step 21) 

    This will prompt you to download the OpenVPN Client Software for your OS 

    Follow the instructions and install the OpenVPN Client on your computer 

    Agree to the terms and conditions 

    Enter the same username and password as you did in 28 

      You may have to import the profile from the page in 30. If so, download the profile and import it into the OpenVPN Client 

    You are now connected to the OpenVPN Access Server running in AWS 

    To test this out, go to Google and enter “what is my IP address” and the public IP of your instance will be returned. You can also test by searching “restaurants near me” and restaurants near where your AWS instance is located will populate. 

    SSH back into your AWS instance from the command line or terminal (step 15) and run the following to update your instance to the latest OS and OpenVPN version 

      Run the commands listed in this article - https://openvpn.net/faq/how-to-upgrade-the-virtual-appliance-to-a-new-version-of-the-access-server/  

      Updated server is OpenVPN Access Server 2.10.3 

    Reboot the server 

    You have successfully created your own VPN server in AWS
